After running this script by including it or requiring it in your
console, the resulting dataset will be in the act_subj variable.

Also, it will have been written into the by_activity_and_subject.csv file

This file has both the activity_name ands subject variables. 
activity_name: This is what the person was doing when the observation was made
subject: It is an integer that uniquely identifies the subject performing the activity.

The rest of the variables in that dataset, are described in the original 
features_info.txt and features.txt files. 

However, it was required I changed the variable (column) names for something better looking. The new_variable_names.txt file, shows you which of the old names correspond to the new ones as such:
____orig_name____=____new_name_____
tBodyAcc-mean()-X=t_body_acc_mean_x
tBodyAcc-mean()-Y=t_body_acc_mean_y
tBodyAcc-mean()-Z=t_body_acc_mean_z
....
Separated by an equal sign.
