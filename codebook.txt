Please make sure you read the ./UHCI HAR Dataset/features*txt files, which describes the original dataset which we refference here. 

After running this script by including it or requiring it in your
console, the resulting dataset will be:

a) In the act_subj variable.

b) Written into the by_activity_and_subject.txt file of the current working directory

The resulting dataset has "activity_name" and "subject" variables as their grouping columns. The rest of the variables are:

a) Measurments as labeled by the features.txt files
b) Extracted from the dirname/X_dirname.txt file, for dirname==test|train.
c) Selected only the ones that have std deviation and mean data, as required.
d) Variable names have been changed to a more sensible standard: all funny characters in the original names have been replaced by an underscore "_", everything has been lowercased. The equivalence of our variable names and the original variable names is documented in the new_variables_names.txt with the follwing format:
____orig_name____=____new_name_____
tBodyAcc-mean()-X=t_body_acc_mean_x
tBodyAcc-mean()-Y=t_body_acc_mean_y
tBodyAcc-mean()-Z=t_body_acc_mean_z
....
As you can see, separated by an equal sign.

All the observed values should be, as in its original form, between -1 and 1 and their units are mostly not important, as everything has been normalized for comparision.
